//! Template prompt constants used by the v10 schema migration.
//!
//! `V4_*` constants are the verbatim strings seeded by migration v4 at
//! [crate::storage::db::seed_builtin_templates] (db.rs:702, 710, 718,
//! 726, 734). They MUST stay byte-identical to those literals — they're
//! the equality guard for the conditional UPDATE in migrate_v10. If a
//! user customized a builtin template's prompt in the UI, their value
//! won't match V4_* and the UPDATE will skip them.
//!
//! `V10_*` constants are the upgraded prompts that replace the v4
//! baselines. They emit richer markdown (bold names/decisions, action
//! item tables, inline code for technical refs) but keep the same
//! `## Section` heading scheme so [parseSections] in the renderer
//! continues to work without changes.
//!
//! `AUTO_*` constants seed the new `builtin-auto` template that becomes
//! the default for fresh installs and for users whose
//! `meeting_default_template` is still the v4 empty-string sentinel.

// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// V4 baselines — verbatim copies from seed_builtin_templates.
