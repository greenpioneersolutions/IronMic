## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-06

### Core Features
- **Voice-to-text transcription** via Whisper large-v3-turbo running locally through whisper.cpp

- **Text-to-speech** via Kokoro 82M ONNX — 15 English voices (American + British), word-level highlighting
- **Global hotkey** (Cmd+Shift+V / Ctrl+Shift+V) — record from anywhere, text copied to clipboard automatically
