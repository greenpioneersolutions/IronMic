IronMic captures your voice, transcribes it with Whisper, optionally polishes it with a local LLM, and copies the result to your clipboard or saves it as a rich-text note. A built-in TTS engine can read your dictations back to you. Everything runs entirely on your machine — no audio or text ever leaves the device.

---

## Features

### Core Dictation
- **Voice-to-clipboard** — Press a global hotkey, speak, press again. Polished text lands in your clipboard, ready to paste anywhere.
- **Voice-to-note** — Dictate directly into a rich text editor (TipTap/ProseMirror) with formatting, headings, lists, code blocks, and more.
- **Whisper large-v3-turbo** — State-of-the-art local speech recognition with GPU acceleration (Metal on macOS).
- **LLM text cleanup** — A local Mistral 7B model removes filler words, fixes grammar, and preserves your meaning. Toggleable per-entry.
- **Custom dictionary** — Add domain-specific terms, names, and jargon to improve transcription accuracy.

### Text-to-Speech Read-Back
- **Kokoro 82M TTS** — Hear your dictations read back through a local neural voice engine.
- **15 English voices** — American and British accents, male and female. Preview and switch in Settings.
- **Speed control** — 0.5x to 2.0x playback speed.
- **Word-level highlighting** — Words highlight in sync as they're spoken (karaoke-style).
- **Auto read-back** — Optionally read text aloud automatically after dictation completes.

### AI Assistant
- **Built-in AI chat** — Wrapper around GitHub Copilot CLI and Claude Code CLI.
- **Context-aware** — Ask questions, refine text, brainstorm — powered by your existing AI subscriptions.
- **Streaming responses** — Real-time token-by-token output.
- **Privacy-first** — The AI feature is off by default. When enabled, it uses your own CLI tools and credentials.

### On-Device Machine Learning <sup>NEW in 1.1.0</sup>

IronMic includes 5 TensorFlow.js-powered ML features that learn from your usage patterns — entirely on-device.

- **Voice Activity Detection** — Filters silence and noise before Whisper, making transcription faster. Configurable sensitivity.
- **Turn Detection** — Detects when you're done speaking. Three modes: push-to-talk, auto-detect (default 3s silence), and always-listening. Enables hands-free conversation loops with the AI assistant.
- **Voice Commands** — Say "search for meeting notes", "open analytics", or "summarize today" — IronMic classifies the intent and executes the action. LLM fallback for complex commands. Voice correction: "no, I meant...".
- **Context-Aware Routing** — Voice input automatically routes to dictation, AI conversation, or command classification based on your active screen. No manual mode switching.
- **Ambient Meeting Mode** — Leave IronMic running during a meeting. It transcribes with speaker awareness, detects when the meeting ends, and generates a summary with action items.
- **Semantic Search** — Search by meaning, not just keywords. "Find everything about the auth redesign" returns semantically related entries across all content.
- **Smart Notifications** — Learns which notifications matter to you and ranks them by predicted importance. Starts with heuristics, improves over time.
- **Workflow Discovery** — Detects repeating action patterns (e.g., "You check GitHub PRs, then update Jira, then dictate a status update every Thursday at 2 PM") and suggests automations.

> All ML models are under 50MB total. All training data stays in SQLite on your machine. Toggle each feature independently in **Settings > Voice AI**.

### Organization & Search
- **Timeline view** — Scrollable card feed of all dictations, newest first.
- **Full-text search** — Instant search across all transcriptions (SQLite FTS5).
- **Semantic search** — AI-powered meaning-based search across all content (TF.js Universal Sentence Encoder).
- **Tags** — Categorize entries with custom tags.
- **Pin & archive** — Pin important entries to the top, archive old ones.
- **Raw vs. polished toggle** — Switch between original transcript and LLM-cleaned version on any entry.
- **Auto-cleanup** — Configure automatic deletion of entries older than N days.

### Analytics <sup>NEW in 1.0.15</sup>
- **Dashboard** — Daily word counts, recording time, words per minute, streaks.
- **Topic classification** — LLM-powered topic tagging with trend charts.
- **Vocabulary richness** — Type-Token Ratio and unique word tracking.
- **Productivity comparison** — Period-over-period metrics.

### Model Management
- **In-app downloads** — Download Whisper, LLM, and TTS models directly from Settings.
- **Manual model import** — If downloads are blocked by a corporate proxy, download models in your browser and import them into IronMic with a file picker. The app validates and copies them to the right location.
- **HTTP proxy support** — Configure a proxy in Settings > Security for corporate networks (HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5).
- **Multiple Whisper sizes** — Switch between tiny, base, small, medium, and large models.
- **GPU acceleration** — Detect and enable Metal (macOS) or CUDA for faster inference.
- **Progress tracking** — Download progress bars with percentage indicators.

### Design & Customization
- **Dark / Light / System theme** — Full theme support with auto mode that follows your OS preference.
- **Configurable hotkey** — Visual key recorder with conflict detection.
- **Rich text editor** — Bold, italic, headings, lists, blockquotes, code, highlights, and more.
- **Enterprise design system** — Clean, professional UI built on Inter font with the IronMic blue accent.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** stable (1.88+) + cargo
- **Node.js** 20+ + npm
- **CMake** (for whisper.cpp / llama.cpp compilation)
- **espeak-ng** (for TTS phonemization): `brew install espeak-ng`
- Platform-specific:
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
  - **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools (C++ workload)
  - **Linux**: `build-essential`, `libasound2-dev`, `libsqlite3-dev`

## Download

Pre-built packages are available on the **[Releases page](https://github.com/greenpioneersolutions/IronMic/releases/latest)**.

| Platform | Artifact |
|----------|----------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `.dmg` |
| Windows | `.exe` installer |
| Linux | `.AppImage` |

**macOS note:** The app is ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer ID), so Gatekeeper flags it as "unidentified developer." If you see **"IronMic is damaged and can't be opened"**, macOS has attached the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute to the downloaded DMG. Strip it before and after installing:

```bash
# Before opening the DMG:
xattr -cr ~/Downloads/IronMic-*.dmg

# After dragging IronMic into /Applications:
xattr -cr /Applications/IronMic.app
```

Then right-click IronMic → **Open** → **Open** on first launch to confirm.

After installing, open IronMic and go to **Settings > Models** to download the speech recognition model (~1.5 GB). The app will walk you through setup on first launch.

> Models run entirely on your machine. Nothing is sent externally.

---

## Quick Start (from source)

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/greenpioneersolutions/IronMic.git
cd IronMic

# One-command dev mode (builds Rust, installs deps, launches everything)
./scripts/dev.sh
```

The dev script:
1. Builds the Rust native addon with Metal GPU + TTS support
2. Installs npm dependencies (if needed)
3. Compiles Electron main & preload TypeScript
4. Launches Vite dev server + Electron concurrently

### Manual Setup

```bash
# Build Rust core
cd rust-core
cargo build --release --features metal,tts
cp target/release/libironmic_core.dylib ironmic-core.node
cd ..

# Install and run frontend
cd electron-app
npm install
npx concurrently "npx vite" "sleep 3 && npx electron ."
```

### Download Models

Models are downloaded through the Settings UI inside the app:
- **Whisper large-v3-turbo** (~1.5 GB) — speech recognition
- **Mistral 7B Instruct Q4** (~4.4 GB) — text cleanup
- **Kokoro 82M** (~163 MB + ~7.5 MB voices) — text-to-speech

## Running Tests

```bash
# Rust tests (225 tests)
cd rust-core
cargo test --no-default-features

# Frontend build verification
cd electron-app
npx vite build
```

## Privacy & Security

These are hard architectural constraints, not policies:

1. **No network calls.** All outbound requests blocked. Model downloads are the only exception, triggered explicitly by you.
2. **Audio never hits disk.** Mic input lives in memory only. Buffers explicitly zeroed after use.
3. **No telemetry.** No analytics, crash reporting, or usage tracking.
4. **Local-only storage.** Single SQLite file in your app data directory.
5. **Sandboxed renderer.** `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: true`.
6. **Model download integrity.** SHA-256 verified, HTTPS-only, domain-validated.

For the full security model, threat analysis, and configuration guide, see **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.

## Feature Flags (Rust)

The Rust core uses Cargo feature flags to conditionally compile heavy dependencies:

| Feature | Dependencies | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `napi-export` (default) | — | Enables N-API function exports |
| `whisper` | whisper-rs | Speech-to-text |
| `metal` | whisper + whisper-rs/metal | GPU acceleration on macOS |
| `llm` | llama_cpp_rs | LLM text cleanup |
| `tts` | ort, ndarray | Kokoro TTS inference |

Tests run with `--no-default-features` to avoid N-API linker dependencies.
